# Questions
## Why not make this game with Inform or TADS?
This game would be more portable, easier to make, and probably better in every way had I made it with Inform or TADS. But sadly I don't have the free time to justify spending a lot of time writing an Inform or TADS game, as much as I'd like to. I've written Inform 6 before. My only justification for this project is that I'm familarizing myself with basic C++, so that is the only reason for the language choice.

## Did you choose to exclude *x* command from Inform/TADS or just forgot it?
I chose to exclude some standard verbs that would have no use in "Alibi" and aren't likely to be noticed. If you want to add a new verb to the game, please feel free to submit a pull request or make a new issue on Github with your suggestion.

## Are these real questions?
No, of course not. In fact, you're the first person to ever find this repo and read this far into the readme. Congratulations!
