# Alibi
An interactive fiction in which you're accused of a crime and have to devise an alibi. Will your story be good enough to keep you out of jail?

**CURRENTLY UNFINISHED**
I uploaded this because I haven't touched it in a while. The game isn't finished, but I kept the scope small to make it completable so I'll definitely finish it soon!

# Installation
1. `./configure`
2. `make`
3. `make install`

# Questions
## Why not make this game with Inform or TADS?
This game would be more portable, easier to make, and probably better in every way had I made it with Inform or TADS. However, the only reason I started this project was for the sake of familarizing myself with basic C++. So that's what I'm using.

## Did you choose to exclude *x* command from Inform/TADS or just forgot it?
I chose to exclude some standard verbs that would have no use in "Alibi" and aren't likely to be noticed. If you want to add a new verb to the game, please feel free to submit a pull request or make a new issue on Github with your suggestion.

## Are these real questions?
No, of course not. In fact, you're the first person to ever find this repo and read this far into the readme. Congratulations!
